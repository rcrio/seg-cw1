## What could've been improved?
Due to time limitations, we were not able to completely deliver the ideal coursework.
We could've added these features:
- Deleting profiles does not delete users.
- We could've hyperlinked places where they show the user's name and ID to make it easier to go to their profiles.
- More text to guide users easier.
- Contact page and general information page.
- The ability to delete your account.
