# Code Tutors: A website managing bookings for tutors and students

A Django application that utilises Bootstrap for the front-end, Python for the back-end, and SQLite for the database.
Data was generated using the Faker library.

- This application is a platform where students can make requests to tutors for tutoring sessions depending on the tutor's availability and taught subjects. 
- Administrators will approve of the requests which will create an invoice.
- Once an invoice is paid, the administrator will approve of the invoice and it will automatically create the session.

This application has 3 types of users, Admins, Tutors and Students.

## What could've been improved?
Due to time limitations, we were not able to completely deliver the ideal coursework.
We could've added these features:
- Deleting profiles does not delete users.
- We could've hyperlinked places where they show the user's name and ID to make it easier to go to their profiles.
- More text to guide users easier.
- Contact page and general information page.
- The ability to delete your account.
